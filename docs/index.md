# Welcome to the Taxonium documentation

Taxonium is a powerful tool for exploring phylogenetic trees.

## Getting started

How you use Taxonium depends on what you want to do.

### Viewing a Newick tree

If you have a tree in Newick format and you just want to view it, you can just go to [Taxonium.org](http://taxonium.org), and select your tree file.

#### Adding metadata to your tree

Optionally, you can also upload a metadata file with your tree. This file should be in TSV or CSV format. It should have a heading with column names. The left-most column should contain the node names as used in the Newick file. The remaining columns should contain metadata for each node.

```{eval-rst}
.. note::
    All files supplied to Taxonium can also have .gz extensions, indicating they are gzipped.
```

### Viewing the global SARS-CoV-2 tree

We maintain an instance of Taxonium that displays a version of the UShER-built SARS-CoV-2 global tree, at [Cov2Tree.org](http://cov2tree.org).

### Using an UShER mutation annotated tree

Taxonium is especially powerful when applied to a tree that has been annotated with mutations. With these trees it can allow searching for mutations, or displaying genotypes. Such trees are often generated by [UShER](https://github.com/yatisht/usher/). Please refer to the UShER documentation for advice on how to make such a tree.

:::{note}
Sometimes you might just want to annotate an existing SARS-CoV-2 tree. You can download MATs pre-built by the UShER team from [here](https://hgwdev.gi.ucsc.edu/~angie/UShER_SARS-CoV-2/), which you can add your own metadata to using `taxonium_to_usher`.
:::

Once you have an UShER-annotated tree, we provide a tool for converting it to a format that Taxonium can use. The Taxonium format is a JSONL file with a list of nodes, each with all of its metadata, and a position. To create such a file we can use the `usher_to_taxonium` tool, from the `taxoniumtools` package.

### Installing taxoniumtools

Taxoniumtools is available from PyPI. You can install it with pip.

```{bash}
pip install taxoniumtools
```

The `usher_to_taxonium` utility will then be available for use.

### Using usher_to_taxonium from taxoniumtools

```{eval-rst}
.. argparse::
   :module: taxoniumtools.src.taxoniumtools.usher_to_taxonium
   :func: get_parser
   :prog: usher_to_taxonium
```
