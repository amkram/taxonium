# Welcome to the Taxonium documentation

Taxonium is a powerful tool for exploring phylogenetic trees.

## Getting started

How you use Taxonium depends on what you want to do.

### Viewing a Newick tree

If you have a tree in Newick format and you just want to view it, you can just go to [Taxonium.org], and select your tree file.

#### Adding metadata to your tree

Optionally, you can also upload a metadata file with your tree. This file should be in TSV or CSV format. It should have a heading with column names. The left-most column should contain the node names as used in the Newick file. The remaining columns should contain metadata for each node.
